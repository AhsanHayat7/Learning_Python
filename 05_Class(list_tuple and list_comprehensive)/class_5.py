# 4.More Loops: All versions of foods.py in this section have avoided using for loops when
# printing, to save space. Choose a version of foods.py, and write two for loops to print each list
# of foods.

# foods.py

# List of fruits
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']

# List of vegetables
vegetables = ['carrot', 'broccoli', 'spinach']

# List of proteins
proteins = ['chicken', 'beef', 'fish']
